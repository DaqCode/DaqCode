- Afternoon gents, name is DaqVid.
- Currently doing some small coding projects involving Renpy, and plan to get more stuff working as the years go by of learning.
- I could use some coders and artists for the upcoming game(It's pretty dumb). 
- Thanks for checking out. I have nothing much else to say.
